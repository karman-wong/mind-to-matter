<h2>Where Creativity and Productivity Meet</h2>
<p>
Albert Einstein, Beethoven, and Madam Curie. What do these three influential figures have in common? They all kept a journal!
Journaling is widely regarded as an important habit that has tremendous benefits for one’s mental health and can allow you to harness your creative potential in a tangible format.
</p>
<p>
Imagine flipping through a journal in your favourite colour, and finding pages upon pages that are filled with thoughts, missed conversations, and doodles at the end of the year.
Do you remember that sunny picnic date you had back in June? Or that time you submitted your final assignment for the semester? Maybe you don’t, but your journal will!
</p>
<p>
Creativity is important, but what happens when we prioritize productivity and habit as well? This is where bullet journaling comes into play.
