<h2>Our Story</h2>
<img src = "./imgs/aboutusimg.jpg" alt = "Bullet Journal">
<p>
The year is 2015. Karman Wong, a student, looked disappointingly at her collection of half filled
journals written in a litter of flimsy pens. She was on the search for a hobby that she could incorporate into her daily
self care routine. Thanks to the help of powerful search engines, her attention was drawn towards journaling, a tried and true hobby that
many people swore by to declutter thoughts.
</p>
<p>
"Why should I journal?" was her next search, and she was met with millions of articles and testimonials about how journaling
had improved people's lives for the better. Here is a short list highlighting some of the many top benefits:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>You can witness your personal growth by reflecting when reading past entries</li>
	<li>Improves physical health by strengthening immune cells called T-lymphocytes and leads to better sleep</li>
	<li>Vastly improves mental health by:
		<ul>
			<li>Managing anxiety by prioritizing problems and concerns</li>
			<li>Provides a healthy and safe outlet for self expression</li>
			<li>Giving a sense of control by tracking symptoms</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Boosts cognitive skills by improving comprehension and memory</li>
	<li>Increases likelihood of achieving goals by establishing a written commitment</li>
</ol>
<p>
After reading many articles, she was determined to give this hobby another try, but it was so easy to neglect a boring notebook
and simply write your thoughts down on a mobile application. The first step was to find the perfect journal, but much to her dismay, Karman found
most of the current products on the market to be either overpriced, low quality, or lacked distinctive features.
</p>
<p>
When she finally found a journal that she could see herself using for the long run, she noticed that all her markers would bleed through and pen marks were visible on the backside of pages.
This deterred her from writing because it was distracting.
</p>
What kept her on track was using the bullet journaling system, a mindful organizational technique that has taken the world by storm.
Bullet journaling assisted its users with tracking the past, organizing the present, and preparing for the future. It combines the basic
planning aspects of an agenda and the personal aspect of a diary together. Karman was always a regular user of the calendar application on her phone,
so it was simple to translate her desire to stay organized into her journal with this system. You can learn more about it by clicking

<p>
Out of frustration that there was not a suitable product for her new bullet journaling hobby, Karman developed <span class="companyname">Mind to Matter</span> in 2018 to introduce
high-quality journals and tools to world.
</p>
<p>
<span class="companyname">Mind to Matter's</span> mission is to help people reconnect with themselves by supplying you with premium products that are deserving of your creative energy and penmanship!
